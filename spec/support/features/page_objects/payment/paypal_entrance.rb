# The paypal entrance page
# Supports two different styles - the original and the angular version
# Note: The angular version was seen and these tests changed to suit, then when I went on my other machine it
# was using the non angular version and I do not understand why.
# So, rather than losing my changes, I made this entrance page so it knew about both and selected the angular
# widget objects if the page appeared to be angular (decided by the title)
